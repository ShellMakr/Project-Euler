Project Euler Solutions



This is a repository containing all my answers to Project Euler questions. I have written the answers in Haskell and tried to use as little default functions of heavy computations in order to test myself.

Please do not use this to improve you standing in Project Euler as you will the the website is primarily for self improvement. It is also for those who have already done some qeustions to see how they can be implimented by someone else.

each file is a solution to a question. Some files are simply functions that can be shared by others such a a prime checker or generator.

Enjoy!!
